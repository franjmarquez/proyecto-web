        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p class="fixJobs">Masi Oka, star of Heroes and Hawaii Five-0, founded Mobius Digital to assemble a creative team capable of producing innovative and unique games. He hired a small crew of people who had previously worked on critically acclaimed independent games such as Elsinore, Paralect, Walden, and the student version of Outer Wilds.</p>
        <p class="fixJobs">That team produced 3 independent iOS and Android games. The company then increased in size as they grew into a Console/PC game studio and released Outer Wilds in May 2019. Most recently, Mobius developed an expansion for Outer Wilds, called Echoes of the Eye, released in September of 2021.</p>
        <p class="fixJobs">At Mobius Digital, we’re dedicated to crafting unique and creative games that challenge and inspire our players. We promote a healthy work environment where people can experiment in weird and wonderful ways. This causes no shortage of opportunities for learning and growth on our small team.</p>
        <p class="fixJobs">Our team celebrated the launch of Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye in September 2021, and we’re currently transitioning to work on our next project.</p>
